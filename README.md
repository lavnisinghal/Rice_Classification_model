# Rice_Classification_model
*Overview:
This project aims to classify rice grains into two types—Cammeo and Osmancik—based on their geometric features.
We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implement a Random Forest Classifier to build an accurate model for rice type identification.

*Data:
The dataset includes geometric features of rice grains, such as:
Length
Width
Perimeter
Area
Compactness
Kernel Length
Kernel Width
Asymmetry Coefficient
Groove Length
Each grain is labeled as either Cammeo or Osmancik.

Dependencies
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter


Conclusion
The project successfully classifies rice grains into Cammeo and Osmancik using geometric features, demonstrating the effectiveness of Random Forest for this task.
